## WuKongIM (Make information transfer easier)

8 years of accumulation, precipitated a high-performance universal communication service,message center, supporting instant messaging, message push, IoT communication, audio and video signaling, live broadcast barrage, customer service system, AI communication, instant community and other scenarios.


(Note: This project is a general underlying instant messaging service. The upper layer needs to dock with its own specific business system (which can be easily docked with its own business system through the webhook and datasource mechanism). The core of this project mainly maintains a large number of long connections of clients and delivers messages according to the message rules of third-party business systems.)

`This project needs to be compiled in a go1.20.0 or higher version.`

Features
--------

- üìö Fully self-developed: WuKongIM uses a self-developed message database, binary protocol, and network library, and supports custom protocols.
- üöÄ High performance: WuKongIM can handle millions of online users and has a throughput of 160,000 messages per second (including database operations).
- üîî Zero dependencies: WuKongIM has no third-party dependencies and is easy to deploy.
- üîê Security: WuKongIM encrypts both message channels and message content to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and message tampering.
- üß± Highly extensible: WuKongIM uses a channel-based design and currently supports group and point-to-point channels. It can be extended to support custom channels for use cases such as chatbots and customer service.
